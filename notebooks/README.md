# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used throughout the development lifecycle of the project. Each notebook serves a specific purpose, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

## 📁 Contents

- `DataPreprocessing.ipynb`: 
  Performs data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.

- `EDAanalysis.ipynb`: 
  Contains visualizations and statistical summaries to explore and understand the dataset.

- `TrainModel.ipynb`: 
  Initial model training, evaluation metrics, and performance benchmarking.

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: 
  Additional or alternative exploratory data analysis and insights.

- `model_training.ipynb`: 
  Advanced or fine-tuned model training workflow, possibly using different algorithms or hyperparameters.

## Notes

- These notebooks are meant for reproducibility and transparency.
- Outputs and visualizations may vary depending on random seeds and data versioning.
- Make sure to install required dependencies listed in the main project README before running any notebook.
